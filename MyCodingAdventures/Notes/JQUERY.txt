JQUERY



	jQuery is a javascript library!


It's a collection of pre-built javascript functions.

jQuery can be used for a variety of things, including such as downloading data from databases.

You need to include jQuery's CDN tag to include it in your website --
-- then utlize the specific jQuery selector ($) --
-- finally, apply jQuery methods on the selected elements.


You can use jQuery's selectors to select elements, classes, and ids.
$("#an-id")  $("element")  $(".a-class")


Here we are using jQuery's .HTML method to instantly select and change the contents of our empty-div.
    $("#empty-div").html("<h1>Hello friends!</h1>");

We can just as easily append a new line using a similarly simple .append method.
    $("#empty-div").append("A pleasure to meet you!");
 ^ ^ ^ (You can still put html tags in append) ^ ^ ^


If we needed each line to be its own div, we could just as easily create a new div.
    var newDiv = $("<div>");
    newDiv.text("A pleasure to meet you!");
newDiv will close the div by itself.
The < > brackets here are dictating that we're creating a NEW element, not selecting an old one.


    // We can then  append it to the other div using the same ".append" method.
    $("#empty-div").append(newDiv);



.html is equivalent to .innerHTML
.append is equivalent to .textContent
.attr is the equivalent of .newAttribute



If we need to apply some CSS, we can quickly do so, using the jQuery ".attr" method.
    newDiv.attr("class", "fancy");
However, if you only provide one class, it's GETTING it rather than setting it.


$(stuffYouWantToClear).empty(); -  will clear whatever you put inside.

It's good.


Stick with minified when adding the CDN link.




$(document).ready(function() {} - this waits for the html to finish loading before executing the script within


if (state === "still") {
        $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-animate"));
        $(this).attr("data-state", "animate");
      }
      else if (state === "animate") {
        $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-still"));
        $(this).attr("data-state", "still");
      }
