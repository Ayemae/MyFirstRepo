BOOTSTRAP


Framework -  A pre-built (css?) template

Must have CDN (Content Delivery Network) link to utilize Bootstrap

If you want JS, you need to also include the JS links

popper.js is required for bootstrap 4


DON'T FORGET TO LINK YOUR BOOTSTRAP STYLE SHEET!

Bootstrap only uses divs, no semantic elements (such as "section")


GRIDS


The Bootstrap framework workss on a grid systems

Bootstrap uses 12 columns

Containers wrap around the whole grid

Rows are defined first within the container (before columns)

Colummns are defined within rows

Columns must NOT total to more than 12!  It can total to LESS, but no more!



<div class="container">
	
	<div class="row">

		<div class="col-md-#">



The 'md' stands for "medium" as in "medium screen size"

You can also use "sm" ("small"?)

If you want, you don't have to specific the number of columns to span-- you can just use the class "col" and
bootstrap will figure out the width based on how many "col" classes you've placed within the row.

You CAN use more than 1 container!

You can adjust the class .emptyDivs to fill blank space

If you don't want your ".container" to be padded+centered, you can used ".container-fluid" instead to fill the whole window.

SUB-ROWS can be identified within columns

SUB-COLUMNS can be identified within sub-rows




There are other css Frameworks, such as Materialize
